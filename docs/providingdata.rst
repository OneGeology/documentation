   This high level introduction text should be consistent with other parts of the www.onegeology.org site and with statements in the "using" part. Maybe link to a canonical statement of purpose on the website. Does it need updating to cover newer types of data that we are dealing with?

The `mission <http://onegeology.org/what_is/mission.html>`_ of OneGeology is being fulfilled by the cooperation of participating member organisations worldwide. This part of the website gives technical guidance on how to provide services for OneGeology to those organisations that fit within the `prospective member guidelines <http://onegeology.org/participants/home.html#statement>`_ and have `registered <http://onegeology.org/getting_involved/home.html>`_ with OneGeology as participants. Some of the guidance may also be of use to others who wish to set up similar services outside OneGeology.

As described in the pages on `using <http://onegeology.org/use/home.html>`_ OneGeology data there are different kinds of data and levels of interaction with that data that are provided by OneGeology services. As a participant you need to decide what kinds of service to set up. This will depend on what data you have available and what level of access you wish to provide to it. You will also need to decide how much effort you are able to spend to harmonise your data with relevant standards. The next sections give an overview of different kinds of data source you might use and what levels of functionality you could provide with different services.
